1. Check the version of your web browser by going to settings>about. Install the correct version of the web driver for your     browser. It only works for Microsoft edge right now
   You can find them here ( https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/?form=MA13LH#downloads)
  eg. If your browser version is Version 135.0.3179.54, then you must download the Version 135.0.3179.54 webdriver.

2. Install the requirements by this command.
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the program
   python antiphisherultimate.py

4. Go to any login page in the opened browser tab and wait for the script to work.(Use only one tab at a time, since there are bugs with multiple tabs running. Still working on it)
